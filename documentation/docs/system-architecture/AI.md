# Ollama - AI Model

CodeLlama is an advanced code generation model developed by Meta AI. It is a large language model (LLM) designed specifically for coding tasks, leveraging the LLaMA architecture to provide efficient and high-quality code completion, generation, and understanding capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Model Sizes**: Available in different sizes, including 7B, 13B, and 34B parameters, to balance performance and efficiency.
- **Context Awareness**: Handles extended code contexts effectively, making it useful for large-scale software projects.
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: Proficient in Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Bash, and more.
- **Optimized for Efficiency**: Uses improved tokenization and inference techniques to enhance coding performance.

## Important Statistics

- **Base Architecture**: LLaMA 2
- **Model Sizes**: 7B, 13B, 34B parameters
- **Training Data**: Trained on a dataset of publicly available code repositories
- **Max Context Length**: Up to 100K tokens

## Use Cases

- **Code Completion**: Assists in writing and finishing code snippets efficiently.
- **Code Generation**: Generates entire functions, classes, and scripts based on prompts.
- **Code Understanding**: Helps in debugging and explaining complex code segments.
- **Refactoring and Optimization**: Suggests improvements and optimizations for better performance.

## Availability

CodeLlama is open-source and available for research and commercial use under Meta's licensing terms.
