# Component Overview

The AI-assisted coding assistant project consists of several key components and technologies, including a **VS Code extension** for code suggestions, a **Flask backend** for processing and logging user interactions, **Ollama** as the AI model, **Supabase** for authentication and database storage, and a **Next.js dashboard** for users to track their progress.

## Main Application  
### 🛠 **VS Code Extension (TypeScript, Node.js)**  
The core of the system is a VS Code extension that provides code suggestions while occasionally introducing small logic errors to test user attentiveness.  

#### 🔹 **Key Features:**  
- **AI-Powered Code Suggestions** – Uses Ollama to generate helpful code recommendations.  
- **Bug Injection** – Sometimes modifies code (e.g., changing `add(a, b)` to `a - b`) to check if users notice mistakes.  
- **User Response Logging** – Tracks how users interact with suggestions (accept, modify, or reject).  
- **Adjustable Difficulty** – Adapts suggestions based on past responses.  

## Backend Services  
### 🚀 **Flask (Python)**  
The backend handles all API requests between the VS Code extension, AI model, and database.  

#### 🔹 **Key Features:**  
- **Processes Code Requests** – Sends user code to the AI model and returns suggestions.  
- **Tracks User Behavior** – Logs whether users accept, modify, or reject suggestions.  
- **Controls Suggestion Flow** – Can slow down suggestions or require manual edits based on user performance.  

## AI Model  
### 🤖 **Ollama (AI Code Generator)**  
The AI model generates code suggestions and sometimes introduces small mistakes to test users.  

#### 🔹 **Key Features:**  
- **Context-Aware Suggestions** – Provides relevant recommendations based on the user’s code.  
- **Intelligent Mistakes** – Occasionally tweaks suggestions with logical errors to test user focus.  
- **Adaptive Learning** – Adjusts suggestions based on user behavior.  

## Database & Authentication  
### 🔐 **Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth)**  
Supabase handles user login and stores all interaction data.  

#### 🔹 **Key Features:**  
- **User Authentication** – Manages logins and keeps track of individual progress.  
- **Logs User Activity** – Records which suggestions were accepted, modified, or rejected.  
- **Real-Time Sync** – Updates and injects user progress instantly to the AI model and on the dashboard.  

## User Dashboard  
### 📊 **Next.js (React, Tailwind CSS)**  
The dashboard allows users to view their progress and track their learning journey.  

#### 🔹 **Key Features:**  
- **Progress Tracking** – Displays stats on correct vs. incorrect responses.  
- **Insightful Feedback** – Helps users understand where they need improvement.  
- **Encourages Learning** – Provides interactive insights to refine coding skills.
