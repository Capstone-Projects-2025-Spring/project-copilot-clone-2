# Use-case descriptions

## Actors
Our project has multiple actors, meaning that different use cases are needed to describe how each actor interacts with the system. 

* **User (beginner programmers)**: Student learning to program, interacting with our Copilot VS Code Extension for code suggestions and asking questions about concepts. 
* **AI Model**: The AI model running on our system that will create code suggestions, answer concept questions, and generate quizzes. 
* **Administrator**: An instructor that wants to monitor students' progress and review logged data from the system to identify concepts that should be reviewed. 

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Recieving Context-Aware Code Suggestions

Actors: User, AI Model

**The user wants to get inline code suggestions to assist with a coding assignment and determine if it is correct or incorrect.**

1. **User** begins typing code.
2. **AI model** analyzes the context of the code and creates a code suggestion (incorrect or correct).
3. System displays the AI model suggestion.  
4. **User** reviews the suggestion and determines if it is correct or not. 
5. **User** selects “Accept” if they think the code is right or “Reject” if they believe it is wrong.
6. System logs the user’s choice, time it took for the user to make a decision, and whether or not it was correct. 
7. *If the user accepts an incorrect suggestion, the AI model gives an explanation of the mistake.*

### Use Case 2: Asking Inline Questions about Code

Actors: User

**The user wants to ask a question about a specific piece of code inline while coding.**

1. **User** highlights a portion of their code.
2. **User** clicks on "ask Copilot" to type a question. 
3. **AI model** provides an explanation for the question. 
4. **User** reviews the response.
5. System logs the user’s question and whether the user requested further clarification. 

### Use Case 3: Asking Questions in the Copilot chat

Actors: User, AI Model

**The user wants to ask a general programming question about a coding concept.**

1. **User** opens ai model chat. 
2. **User** types a question (e.g. "How do for loops work in Java?")
3. **AI model** processes the question and returns an answer.
4. **User** reviews the response.
5. System logs the user’s question and whether the user requested further clarification. 

### Use Case 4: Logging Decision Time for Code Suggestions

Actors: User, AI Model

**The system has to track how long a user takes to accept or reject a suggestion to ensure the user is actually engaging with the code.**

1. System begins a timer when it suggests code to the user.  
2. **User** reviews the suggestion (as quickly or slowly as they want).
3. **User** accepts or rejects the suggestion. 
4. System stops the timer and logs the response time.
5. *If the user consistently makes quick and random wrong selections, the system flags them for potential disengagement or lack of knowledge on the subject matter.*


### Use Case 5: Recieving Feedback After Selecting a Suggestion. 

Actors: User

**The user wants to recieve feedback on whether they correctly identified a suggestion as right or wrong.**

1. **User** accepts or rejects a suggestion.   
2. System determines if the user's choice was correct. 
3. *If the **user** chose correctly, system provides confirmation.*
4. *If the **user** chose incorrectly, system provides an explanation of the mistake.* 
5. System logs the mistake for admin review. 

### Use Case 6: Tracking and Logging User Decisions

**The system has to track user engagement, correctness, and common errors.**

1. System logs each accepted or rejected code suggestion. 
2. System tracks if the choice was correct or incorrect.
3. System records how long the user took to decide on accepting or rejecting. 
4. *If user frequently accepts incorrect suggestions, system logs recurring mistakes for admin review.*
5. *If multiple users make the same mistakes, system flags the concept as a struggle area.*

### Use Case 7: Identifying Common Student Mistakes

**The AI model will identify patterns that the system has logged based on incorrect acceptionns and user struggles. 

1. System records incorrect suggestions that user accepts. 
2. The AI model analyzes repeated mistakes, and extracts the concepts that need work. 
3. The concept extracted by the model will be flagged by the system to be reviewed by the administrator.
