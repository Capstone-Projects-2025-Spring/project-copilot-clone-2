# System Overview

## Project Abstract

## Conceptual Design

## Background
AI-powered code assistants like OpenAI's Chat GPT and Github's Copilot have revolutionized software development, enabling programmers to write code faster and with fewer errors. However, they have also hindered the abilities of more novice programmers. These programmers will accept the solution they are given often times without fully understanding the concepts and in some cases without reading the solution. This can lead to a lot of poor programming practices. Our project is trying to address this by implementing a system the provides these intelligent code suggestions but requires the user to fully understand the code they are getting suggested before it is placed in their project. With this approach we hope that AI coding assistance can still be used by newer programmers while still promoting learning and good programming habits.
